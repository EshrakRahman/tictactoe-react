# 🎯 React Deep Dive – Essentials & Advanced Concepts  
[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20Demo-Netlify-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=netlify)](https://eshrakrahman.netlify.app/)


This repository documents my continued journey learning **React**, moving from fundamentals to more advanced concepts.  
It begins by improving a demo application from a previous section and then evolves into a fully interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built with React.

## 🧠 What I Explored
- **JSX & Non-JSX Alternatives** – Understanding how JSX compiles under the hood  
- **Component Structure** – Organizing and nesting components for scalability  
- **State Management** – Revisiting `useState` and applying advanced state techniques  
- **Patterns & Best Practices** – Cleaner, more maintainable code  
- **Project Refactoring** – Improving clarity and structure of existing code

## ✍️ Reflection

This section deepened my understanding of how React really works — not just how to use it.
I learned to think in components, manage data flow through state and props, and structure a React project for clarity.

Building the Tic-Tac-Toe game was especially valuable for practicing interactive UI logic and exploring real-world React patterns.
It’s a small but meaningful step toward writing scalable, production-quality React code.

## 🔜 Next Steps

* Learn **React Context API** and **useReducer** for complex state management
* Explore **custom hooks** and **reusable UI components**
* Practice deploying React apps using **Vercel** or **Netlify**
